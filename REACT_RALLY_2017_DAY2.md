# Convergent Evolution -- Evan Czaplicki (ElmJS)

## Elm vs. React

Elm -> immutable & functional
Elm -> forces patterns -- good and bad ways to use it
Both have the concept of static data analysis

# So how does Babel even work? Let's create the JSX transform to find out! -- Henry Zhu (Behance)

'Compiler that compiles JS to JS' -- lol
Look up AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
Compile PHP to JS -> https://babeljs.io/php/

## ASTExplorer
- Go to astexplorer.net\
- Watch ES2015+ compile to ES5 real-time

## Contribute
Contribute at https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Future
- TC39 needs feedback to control the future

## What it means to be a contributor?
- Just do it
- There's no right way
- `Code doesn't matter, people do`
- Just show up
- Open Source community will help you and the code better

# Scaling My First Enterprise React App! üêô -- Jennifer Van (Capital 1)

## Hallmarks of enterprise products?
1. Persist
2. Grow
3. Testing

## Scaling Properly
- Scaling means that apps are still performant

### But how?
1. Define presentation vs container components
2. Utilize performance timeline to determine bottlenecks
   append ?react-perf
3. Remove unnecessary renders
   Utilize `shouldComponentUpdate` to short circuit unnecessary renders
4. Prioritize network calls
   Go to network tab and sort Priority
   - Priority of rendering elements
   - Escalate  text priority (add rel="preload" to whatever resource is being fetched -- css & js)
     a. High: HTML, Styles, AJAX/

## Keeping Redux fast
1. Set state is okay
2. Connect @ multiple components
3. Normalize state shape (
   - each type of data gets its own table
   - each object gets its own id as a key

## File Structure
```
Root
  |_ JS
      |_ Components
          |_ Presentation
          |_ Container
```

## Documentation

Write code that is understandable and comprehensive, but when all else fails, make sure complex logic that is not immediately comprehensive is documented.


## Static Code Analysis

Use TypeScript and linters


## How to prevent growing pains when user base grows

### Accessibility
These are common forgotten users

## Testing for Accessibility
1. Keyboard testing
2. Assistive Technology Support (Screen Readers)
3. reactrally

## Testing in React/Redux

JUST DO IT

Check out:
1. Enzyme
2. Jest
3. Mocha
